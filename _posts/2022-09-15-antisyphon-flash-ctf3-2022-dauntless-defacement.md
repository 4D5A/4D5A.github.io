### Explanation
Examine a packet capture to locate a flag.

### Solving the Challenge
1. Download defacement.pcap and open it with Wireshark
2. According to the challenge description, we are examining a packet capture that includes network traffic created while an attacker defaced a website so we are going to apply a Wireshark display filter for http.
3. To follow the TCP stream, right click the first packet, click Follow, and click TCP Stream.

4. Use the up arrow for Stream in the bottom right corner of the window to move through each stream.

5. Stream 8 shows what appears to be an attacker attempting to obtain a shell and use that to make a nc connection to a C2 server with the IP address 192.168.1.197.

6. In Stream 9, we see what appears to be an attacker downloading a file named hack.zip from hxxp://192.168.1.197:2446/hack.zip.

7. Looking through Stream 9, we see the attacker unzip hack.zip and enter the password ```ASup3rL33tUncr4ckabl3P4ssw0rd```.

8. By clicking File, Export Objects, and HTTP..., we can look for HTTP objects in the packet capture.
9. Select the HTTP object for the zip file.

10. Use 7zip to open hack.zip

11. Enter the password ```ASup3rL33tUncr4ckabl3P4ssw0rd```.
12. The flag is located in secret.txt.
